Iâ€™m a Ph.D. candidate in Advanced Design & Systems Engineering at City University of Hong Kong (CityU), where I am so fortunate to be supervised by [Prof. Chuangyin DANG](https://www.cityu.edu.hk/adse/mecdang.htm). I obtained my B.E. degree in automation from Harbin Institute of Technology in 2021.

My research areas including:
Game Theory and Applications, Economics and Computation.
